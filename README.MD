# Auctioneer - Decentralized Auction Platform

Auctioneer is a blockchain-powered decentralized auction platform designed to ensure secure, transparent, and fair bidding. Using Ethereum smart contracts, the platform eliminates intermediaries, reduces fees, and enhances security for auction-based transactions.

## Features
- Trustless bidding process secured by Ethereum smart contracts.
- Transparent and immutable auction history stored on the blockchain.
- Direct interaction between buyers and sellers without intermediaries.
- User-friendly interface for seamless participation in auctions.
- Secure fund transfers for winning bids.

## Contract Details
- **Contract Address:** 0x<your_contract_address_here>
- **Network:** Ethereum Testnet (e.g., Sepolia or Mantle Sepolia)

## Deployment
- **Contract Address:** View on Explorer
- **Coin Used:** ETH (Sepolia Testnet ETH)

## How to Use
1. **Connect Wallet:** Users connect their wallet via MetaMask to participate in auctions.
2. **Create Auction:** Sellers create an auction by specifying item details and starting parameters.

5. **View History:** Users can view their past auctions and bids on the blockchain.

2. Deploy the smart contract on a test network.
3. Configure the frontend to interact with the deployed contract.
4. Connect MetaMask to create auctions and place bids.

## Future Enhancements
